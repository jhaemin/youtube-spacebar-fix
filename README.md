# YouTube Space bar Fix

![Issue](https://github.com/jhaemin/dynamic-island/assets/19797697/4c78dcf9-2bdc-4bbe-bd9a-cd69fbb315a6)

By pressing the left or right arrow keys on YouTube video player, the active element is changed to the progress bar. After that, pressing the space bar doesn't pause or play the video anymore.

This browser extension fixes the problem.

> You can just press K to play or pause the video regardless of the active element. But I'm already used to pressing the space bar.
